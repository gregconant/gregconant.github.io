We've been dealing with some pretty old code lately. And by "lately", I mean "always". As a result, we have frequent discussions about refactoring (and, jokingly, rewriting the entire thing).

I've been encouraging the team to take more of a "do what we can to write tests around this, even if it's ugly" mentality, because I don't see another way to get the codebase to improve.
